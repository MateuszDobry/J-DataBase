java-DataBase

Java-DataBase is an advanced database system created by me and two other collaborators (@Satan-Vicovaro, @Veruan), specifically designed for managing rabbit data. 
This system utilizes a multi-threaded sorting mechanism, allowing for efficient organization of the information stored in the database. 
The application is enhanced with comprehensive unit tests using Mockito, ensuring its reliability and correctness. 
Additionally, Java-DataBase supports TCP connections, enabling smooth data transmission between the client and server. 
This architecture promotes effective communication and data exchange, making it a powerful tool for managing and retrieving rabbit-related information from the database.
